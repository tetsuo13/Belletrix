# Belletrix

Belletrix is a student relationship management solution geared toward reducing the effort required to run a study abroad office.

## History

Belletrix was a contract job by a small college from 2014-2016 and open sourced with permission from the client.

It was created with the initial requirement to provide features not found in a similar project, [AbroadOffice](http://www.globallearningcloud.com/ao-overview/) by Global Learning Cloud, which was being evaluated at the same time. Belletrix has branched away from AbroadOffice early on to become its own solution in the study abroad office CRM space.

## Continuation

While all development of Belletrix has stopped, it is made available for self-hosting and continued development under the license given. If your college or institution is interested in it, please feel free to use it as-is or fork it for your needs.
